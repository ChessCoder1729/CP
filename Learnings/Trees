Convert Tree to Array

Binary Lifting

It is a common technique to calculate two DP arrays
One DP array for results within the subtree (Sometimes only this)
Other DP array calculates results outside of the subtree (sometimes only this)

dist(u,v) = depth[u] + depth[v] - 2*depth[lca]	

In HLD seg = new SegTree; if(depth[u]>depth[v]) and if(depth[head[u]]<depth[head[v]])
In HLD dont forget depth[0] = 0, parent[0] = -1;
