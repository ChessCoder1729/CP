1. DP?
2. Try answering queries in reverse order?

3. Check for queue, priorioty_queue, stack, ordered_set solutions
stack => LIFO (whatever goes in last comes out last)
queue => FIFO (whatever goes in first comes out first)
priority_queue => Dynamic queries of minimum/maximum
ordered_set => set in vector form
[order_of_key(k) gives number of elements less than k, find_by_order(i) gives i^th element]

4. n/1 + n/2 + n/3 .... = nlogn
5. Binary Search the Answer(or just Binary Search)
6. Bitmask
7. For sets use s.lower_bound() 
8. When using class and struct dont forget to put the value in the "global" variable
9. Dont forget to put is_set = true in lazysegtree
10. #define endl '\n'
11. In HLD seg = new SegTree; if(depth[u]>depth[v]) and if(depth[head[u]]<depth[head[v]])
12. In HLD dont forget depth[0] = 0, parent[0] = -1;
